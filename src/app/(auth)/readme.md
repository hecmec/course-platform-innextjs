| **itsdrvgo/nextjs-jwt-auth-example**                            | Next.js + JWT based authentication; includes signup, login, etc. It uses Drizzle ORM + Postgres. ([GitHub][1])                                      | Very close: has JWT, Drizzle, Next.js, user management (register/login) etc.                               | More of a demo / example than full production-ready; might need you to add in “deleteMe” etc. Also maybe not super fleshed out UIs. ([GitHub][1])                                                  |
| **nrjdalal/onset**                                              | A Next.js 14 starter with Drizzle + Postgres + Auth.js. Clean starter structure. ([GitHub][2])                                                      | Pretty close: Auth.js is used (so supports signup/login etc.), Drizzle + Postgres. Good for bootstrapping. | It is a starter; “deleteMe” or user self-delete may not be included by default, so you'd need to add that. Also depending on JWT vs session or provider-based auth, may need tweaks. ([GitHub][2]) |
| **wpcodevo/nextauth-nextjs14-drizzle**                          | Tutorial + example of integrating Drizzle ORM with NextAuth.js in Next.js 14. Includes Credentials auth, OAuth, protected routes etc. ([GitHub][3]) | Very good: covers many pieces, and has a real codebase to adapt.                                           | Again, might not have *exactly* “deleteMe” or advanced user account deletion, so you might need to implement that. Also, token lifetime / JWT config etc may need customization. ([CodevoWeb][4])  |
| **Vercel template: Next.js Postgres Auth Starter with Drizzle** | A starter kit: Next.js + Drizzle + Postgres + NextAuth.js, email/password login etc. ([Vercel][5])                                                  | Also very good: very close to what you want; Email/password + Postgres + Drizzle.                          | Likely simpler set of features (again, may need to add things like delete account, maybe extra JWT customization). Also deployment / environment config will need your adjustments. ([Vercel][5])  |
